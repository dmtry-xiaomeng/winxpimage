# winxpimage
Windows XP OVA virtual image file to be used on Virtual Box, VmWare.

This image was created for students that are learning pentesting in order to follow many penetratin testing books like "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking". Today is very hard to find Windows XP images or even ISO's so I had created this to help you out. This is a clean installation. I had created the OVA file right after the Windows XP instalation from the ISO file and this can save you some time.

# Disclaimer!
Be careful using this machine as Windwows XP is not support by Microsoft long time ago and it's full of vulnerabilities! Use it with care!
